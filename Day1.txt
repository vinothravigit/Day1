Write a blog on Difference between HTTP1.1 vs HTTP2

HTTP/1.1 and HTTP/2 are two versions of the Hypertext Transfer Protocol, which is the foundation 
of data communication on the World Wide Web. Here are some key differences between HTTP/1.1 and HTTP/2:

1. Multiplexing:
HTTP/1.1: Uses a single connection per request, which means that multiple requests from a client may result in multiple connections.
HTTP/2: Supports multiplexing, allowing multiple requests and responses to be multiplexed over a single connection. This improves efficiency and reduces latency.
2. Header Compression:
HTTP/1.1: Headers are not compressed, leading to larger overhead and slower performance.
HTTP/2: Utilizes header compression, which significantly reduces the amount of data that needs to be transmitted and improves performance.
3. Binary Protocol:
HTTP/1.1: Uses a text-based protocol, which can be human-readable but is less efficient for machines to parse.
HTTP/2: Employs a binary protocol, which is more compact and efficient for both machines and humans.
4. Prioritization:
HTTP/1.1: Does not support prioritization of resources. All resources are fetched in the order they are requested.
HTTP/2: Introduces stream prioritization, allowing the client to indicate the priority of resources. This ensures that more critical resources are fetched first.
5. Server Push:
HTTP/1.1: Clients need to explicitly request each resource, even if they are required to render a page.
HTTP/2: Supports server push, allowing the server to push resources to the client's cache without explicit requests, improving page load times.
6. Connection Handling:
HTTP/1.1: Requires multiple connections for parallelism, leading to increased latency.
HTTP/2: Achieves parallelism over a single connection, reducing latency and improving efficiency.
7. Backward Compatibility:
HTTP/1.1: Widely supported and has better compatibility with older systems.
HTTP/2: While widely adopted, not all servers and clients support HTTP/2. However, most modern browsers and servers do.
8. TLS Usage:
HTTP/1.1: TLS (HTTPS) is optional.
HTTP/2: Encourages the use of TLS, and many implementations only support it over HTTPS.

Exploring Objects and Their Internal Representation in JavaScript.

JavaScript, as a versatile and dynamic programming language, relies heavily on objects as a fundamental data structure. 
Objects play a crucial role in organizing and manipulating data within the language. In this blog, we'll delve into the internal representation
of objects in JavaScript, exploring how they are structured and how their properties are managed.

JavaScript engines use various mechanisms to represent objects efficiently. One common approach is the use of a hash table (or dictionary) 
to store the object's properties and their corresponding values. Each property's name is hashed to an index in the table, providing quick 
access to the associated value.
